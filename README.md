# 102 Reading Notes Journal!

Hi my name is **Norman Matthew, Jr** and I'm excited to take the Code Fellows software development course.

### Growth Mindset

What does the *growth mindset* means to me? It is an positive mindset approach to tackle obstacles, setbacks, and self-doubt.

1. If you feel like avoiding challenges, a growth mindset embraces it
2. If you feel like quitting, don't give up try a different approach
3. If you are uncomfortable with criticsms, it says learn from it instead
