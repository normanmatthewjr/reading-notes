### What is CSS?

_Cascading Style Sheets_ or **CSS** is a tool that allows you stylize your website. HTML can have CSS embedded inside it, but it makes complicated and hard to read. By creating file with the **.css** extension, you can call it in your *HTML* and it would work the same. You write the code in a CSS syntax.

What is CSS syntax? It defines the rules by "specifying the groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or group of element."

Here is an example of how css syntax looks. I created a **styles.css** files then use it to stylize my **index.html** to appear how I want it to look.

'h1 {
'    background-color: rgb(41, 41, 129);
'    border-style:inset;
'    color:blanchedalmond;
'    border: 0px;
'    margin: 0px;
'    padding: 20px;
'    }
'body {
'    background-color: rgb(141, 241, 241);
'    border: 0px;
'    margin: 0px;
'    padding: 0px;
'}
'
Now all '<h1>' tags and the '<body>' tag inside of the *html* file will have these properties.
