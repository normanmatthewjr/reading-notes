# Read: 01 - Learning Markdown

What is **Markdown** language? It is a simpler form of writing code using symbols that will transformed into html code. It makes it easier to write codes by removing the tag operation that _HTML_ is known for.

### Examples of Markdown (md)

1. **md** uses **# Symbol** tranformed into **h1** in _HTML_
2. Italize uses the _underline symbol(_)_ instead of **em**
3. Bold uses the **Asterisk** symbol instead of **strong**

- The **dash** would be used instead of **ul li** to create a unordered list
- A **number** follow by a period will start the **ol li** or ordered list
- There is no need for the **br** as you'll just skip a line in **md**
