### Control flow

What is *control flow*? 
>It is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. -- MDN website

If there is a conditional structure like an "if else" statement in Javascript. The *flow* will check if the **if** condition is met first, if it is then the code finishes and move on to the next. If not, it will
go to the **else** condition and execute the next statement. Below is an example of the JS.

```
if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
```
